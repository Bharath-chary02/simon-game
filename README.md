# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors generated by the game. This is a beginner-friendly project developed as part of my front-end web development practice.

## How to Play

1. Click the **Start** button to begin the game.
2. A color will flash on the screen.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. Each correct round adds a new color to the sequence.
5. A wrong input ends the game. Click **Restart** to try again.

## Features

- Responsive UI with four interactive color blocks.
- Layout shift prevention using CSS techniques (`visibility: hidden`).
- Real-time score tracking after each correct input.
- Clear reset mechanism to restart the game after failure.

## What I Learned

- JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Implementing game logic and managing state transitions.
- CSS layout design, alignment, and UI enhancements.
- Handling user interaction through event-driven programming.

## Tech Stack

- HTML for page structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for game logic and interaction
